    <li>Meanwhile, cook the lasagna noodles according to the package directions. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, 1-1/2 cups of the mozzarella cheese, and 1/4 cup of the Parmesan cheese.</li>
    <li>In a 13x9 inch baking dish, spread 1 cup of the meat sauce. Layer 4 of the cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce, then spread 1/2 of the cheese mixture over the noodles. Repeat the layers of sauce, noodles, and cheese mixture. Finally, top with the remaining sauce.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese and 1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese over the top of the lasagna.</li>
